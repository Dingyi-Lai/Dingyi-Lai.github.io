Updated: The following report was written in Chinese at the end of 2017, so lots of observation and analysis are outdated and biased due to my limited knowledge and perspective at that time, and the translation could be flawed. But the paradigm of stock assessment is still practical, because according to the performance of TTM subsequently, my assessment and prediction conforms perfectly to the reality afterwards.

# Abstract
TATA MOTOR Ltd. has experienced intense volatility of share price under the ticker symbol TTM since it listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2004. It can be seen from the field study and the Indian index that foreigners are optimistic about the Indian market, but after analyzing the financial reports of Tata Motors over the years, it can be concluded that Tata Motors is in a poor financial situation. Its biggest advantage is Jaguar, which was acquired from Ford in 2008. Land Rover, and the main market is in China. Recently, Tata Group has stepped up efforts to prevent other groups from acquiring Tata Motors, which is worrying. However, we can infer from the relationship between the stock price, the price-to-book value ratio and the price-earnings ratio that Tata Motors' current EPS has risen sharply. In terms of the stock price, Tata Motors will rise sharply in the short term in the near future, and investors can take a long positon from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018. However, from the financial reports of the past years, three rules of thumb can be used to roughly estimate respectively. The reasonable share price of Tata Motors should be 23.86, 27.85 and 33.75 respectively, and no matter which one is, from the current share price of Tata Motors at 33.87, it is expensive. Hence, in the relative long run, investors are suggested to be short.

# Industry Research
## Goal
Familiar with the overall picture and pattern of the industry, understand the prospects and cycles of the industry

## Field Trip
I arrived in India shortly after India's GST reform in 2017 for internship and volunteering, and my footprints spanned the north and south of India. Though I worked basically in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, I also visited the Silicon Valley of Asia - Bangalore, Cochin and other places. I chose India because I want to see the faces of other third world developing countries in the world. Some people say that the world is a group of people running at high speed day and night, and another group of people wake up and find that the world has changed. I don't want to judge, but there is no doubt that the current India and the former China are belong to the first group. Because it is a fact that China's economic growth has slowed down and that it pays more attention to social welfare, it is also a fact that India's economic growth rate has surpassed China's in one fell swoop. When China's demographic dividend is slowly disappearing and the traditional market is approaching saturation, why don't we turn our attention to other corners of the world?

Perhaps from India we can find the shadow of China's past, from Japan we can see China's future. Some of my conjectures are supported and some are overthrown during my observation:

- Conjecture 1: India's macroeconomic growth falls short of expectations. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 1: On September 1, 2017, I read from The Time of India newspaper: After the GST tax reform, India's GDP growth of 5.7% from April to June was a 3-year low; while China's growth rate remained at 6.9% during the same period.

- Conjecture 2: The industrial development in India is extremely uneven, and the tertiary industry is far stronger than the primary and secondary industries. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 2: This is what I came up with while chatting with my friends who are Indian college students. While taking me to visit their university, they complained that Chinese manufacturing is all over the streets of India. Most of the items used by Indians are made in China, but there are very few made in India. 

- Conjecture 3: The Indian government is planning to support the manufacturing industry. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 3: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan about "Make in India" launched in 2014 has become one of the most important policy initiatives for India's development. In Indian shopping malls, many stores were advertising their identities as local brands.

- Conjecture 4: India's GST tax reform will have a huge impact on the Indian economy, especially on consumption in the short term. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 4: This tax reform happened just a few days before I arrived in India, and housing prices suddenly skyrocketed. Obviously, this reform has greatly affected my living expenses in India. The 14% tax in the restaurant industry really made me complain.

- Conjecture 5: For Indians, oil prices are very high, so cars are a luxury for normal Indians, and the car market has great potential. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 5: A girl belong to Kshatriya once asked me if there are many two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers in my country. I said, of course, generally a family has one or two four-wheeled vehicles. Although two-wheeled vehicles are banned in many big cities, in small cities, a family will usually have one, but still, tricycles are rare because of traffic rules. She was very surprised because in India everyone wants as many cars as possible, no matther whether they are two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers. Among the three people around me, one has four cars at home, and the other two have three cars each. According to their description, Indians are very longing for cars, but because of high oil prices, not all families can afford it. Vehicles are also a good dowry in Indian weddings, and the automotive industry has great potential in the Indian market.

- Conjecture 6: India's environment issue has made it consider the necessary of electric vehicles. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 6: Cited from The Time of India newspaper on September 3, 2017: In 2016, China accounted for more than 40% of the electric cars sold in the world, with 336000 new cars registered. That is more than double that sold in US. China also has the largest electric car stock, with about a third of the global total. From my observation in India, I can see that the expectations for electric vehicles in India are very high.

- Conjecture 7: Tata Motors is the largest car company in India. (Overthrown)
    - Phenomenon 7: Before I went to India, I had only heard of Tata when I try to list an Indian company. But after I met a girl who used to work in the social sector of Tata Motors and heard of her description of the work, I found that this large, socially rewarding Indian conglomerate might not be the largest Indian car company.

- Conjecture 8: Foreigners are very optimistic about the Indian market. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 8: This is the experience that I was shared with by many young venture capitalists who I met along the way.

- Conjecture 9: Tata Motors is well managed and financially sound. (Overthrown)
    - Phenomenon 9: Many of their employees were on short-term contract. For example, one of my friends who was forced to leave after working on a project in their social science department. It shows that Tata Motors had been ensuring the elite and young blood.

## Macroeconomic Research
### Indian economy (validation of conjectures 1, 2 and 4): GDP growth overall and in three industries
Note: The following fiscal years are divided into March, for example, FY18 is from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. From fiscal year 2016 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 (i.e. March 31, 2015 to July 31, 2017), we can get the following macro data1:

  <figcaption>Figure 1: India's GDP growth overall and in three industries from FY16Q1 to FY18Q1</figcaption>
</figure>

From the above figure, we can see that after experiencing rapid development from 2015 to 2016, India's economic growth slowed down significantly after 2016, and the recent economic growth rate was only 5.7%. After experiencing a recession in 2015, the primary industry (agriculture) accelerated again in 2016, but the growth rate in 2017 was not large; the secondary industry (industry) has almost shown a gradual slowdown since 2016 In contrast, the tertiary industry (service industry) performed strongly and gradually became the main force of India's GDP growth. India's film industry and tourism industry maintained a booming trend.

It shows that India is undergoing an era of industrial transformation, but can the weakness of the primary and secondary industries support the huge tertiary industry? The underperforming secondary sector appears to be the main factor behind the slowdown in India's GDP growth. The GST reform (Goods and Service Tax, GST) has had a negative impact on the manufacturing sector, delaying related investment activities.
