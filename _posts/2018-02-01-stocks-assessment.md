Updated: The following report was written in Chinese originally at the end of 2017, so lots of observation and analysis are outdated and biased due to my limited knowledge and perspective at that time, and the translation could be flawed. But the paradigm of stock assessment is still practical, because according to the performance of TTM subsequently, my assessment and prediction conforms perfectly to the reality afterwards.

# Abstract
TATA MOTOR Ltd. has experienced intense volatility of share price under the ticker symbol TTM since it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2004. Generally, foreigners are optimistic about the Indian market according to both my field study and the Indian index. However, the financial reports of Tata Motors over the years infers that Tata Motors is unfortunately in a poor financial situation. Its most competitive advantage is Jaguar Land Rover, which was acquired from Ford in 2008, and its main market is in China. Recently, Tata Group has stepped up efforts to prevent other groups from acquiring Tata Motors, which is worrying. However, we can infer from the relationship among the stock price, the price-to-book value ratio and the price-earnings ratio that Tata Motors' current EPS has risen sharply. In terms of the stock price, Tata Motors will rise sharply in the short term in the near future, and investors can take a long positon from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018. However, from the financial reports of the past years, three rules of thumb can be used to roughly estimate respectively. The reasonable share price of Tata Motors should be 23.86, 27.85 and 33.75 respectively, and no matter which one it should be, the current share price of Tata Motors, 33.87, is too expensive. Hence, in the longer run, investors are suggested to be short.

# Industry Research
## Goal
Familiar with the overall picture and pattern of the industry, understand the prospects and cycles of the industry

## Field Trip
I arrived in India shortly after India's GST reform in 2017 for an volunteer internship, and my footprints spanned the north and south of India. Though I worked basically in Mumbai, Maharashtra, I also visited the Silicon Valley of Asia - Bangalore, Cochin and other cities. I chose India because I want to see the faces of other third world developing countries in the world. Some people comment that the world is a group of people running at high speed day and night, and another group of people wake up and find that the world has changed. I don't want to judge, but there is no doubt that the current India and the former China are belong to the first group. Because it is a fact that China's economic growth has slowed down and that it pays more attention to social welfare, it is also a fact that India's economic growth rate has surpassed China's in one fell swoop. When China's demographic dividend is slowly disappearing and the traditional market is approaching saturation, why don't we turn our attention to other corners of the world?

Perhaps in India we can find the shadow of China's past, in Japan we can peep at China's future. Some of my conjectures are supported and some are overthrown during my field trip:

- Conjecture 1: India's macroeconomic growth falls short of expectations. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 1: On September 1, 2017, I read from The Time of India newspaper: After the GST tax reform, India's GDP growth of 5.7% from April to June was a 3-year low; while China's growth rate remained at 6.9% during the same period.

- Conjecture 2: The industrial development in India is extremely uneven, and the tertiary industry is far stronger than the primary and secondary industries. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 2: This is what I came up with while chatting with my friends who are Indian college students. While taking me to visit their university, they complained that Chinese manufacturing is all over the streets of India. Most of the items used by Indians are made in China, but there are very few made in India. 

- Conjecture 3: The Indian government is planning to support the manufacturing industry. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 3: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan about "Make in India" launched in 2014 has become one of the most important policy initiatives for India's development. In Indian shopping malls, many stores were advertising their identities as local brands.

- Conjecture 4: India's GST tax reform will have a huge impact on the Indian economy, especially on consumption in the short term. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 4: This tax reform happened just a few days before I arrived in India, and housing prices suddenly skyrocketed. Obviously, this reform has greatly affected my living expenses in India. The 14% tax in the restaurant industry really made me complain.

- Conjecture 5: For Indians, oil prices are very high, so cars are a luxury for normal Indians, and the car market has great potential. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 5: A girl belong to Kshatriya once asked me if there are many two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers in my country. I said, of course, generally a family has one or two four-wheeled vehicles. Although two-wheeled vehicles are banned in many big cities, in small cities, a family will usually have one, but still, tricycles are rare because of traffic rules. She was very surprised because in India, everyone wants as many cars as possible, no matther whether they are two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers. Among the three people around me, one has four cars at home, and the other two have three cars each. According to their description, Indians are very longing for cars, but because of high oil prices, not all families can afford it. Vehicles are also a good dowry in Indian weddings, and the automotive industry has great potential in the Indian market.

- Conjecture 6: India's environment issue has made it consider the necessary of electric vehicles. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 6: Cited from The Time of India newspaper on September 3, 2017: In 2016, China accounted for more than 40% of the electric cars sold in the world, with 336000 new cars registered. That is more than double that sold in US. China also has the largest electric car stock, with about a third of the global total. From my observation in India, I can see that the expectations for electric vehicles in India are very high.

- Conjecture 7: Tata Motors is the largest car company in India. (Overthrown)
    - Phenomenon 7: Before I went to India, I had only heard of Tata when I try to list an Indian company. But after I met a girl who used to work in the social sector of Tata Motors and heard of her description of the work, I found that this large, socially rewarding Indian conglomerate might not be the largest Indian car company.

- Conjecture 8: Foreigners are very optimistic about the Indian market. (Supported)
    - Phenomenon 8: This is the experience that I was shared with by many young venture capitalists who I met along the way.

- Conjecture 9: Tata Motors is well managed and financially sound. (Overthrown)
    - Phenomenon 9: Many of their employees were on short-term contract. For example, one of my friends who was forced to leave after working on a project in their social science department. It shows that Tata Motors had been ensuring the elite and young blood.

## Macroeconomic Research
### Indian economy (validation of conjectures 1, 2 and 4): GDP growth overall and in three industries
Note: The following fiscal years are divided into March, for example, FY18 is from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. From fiscal year 2016 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 (i.e. March 31, 2015 to July 31, 2017), we can get the following macro data[^1]:

  alt="GDP_growth_1618">
  <figcaption>Figure 1: India's GDP growth overall and in three industries from FY16Q1 to FY18Q1</figcaption>
</figure>

From the above figure, we can see that after experiencing rapid development from 2015 to 2016, India's economic growth slowed down significantly after 2016, and the recent economic growth rate was only 5.7%. After experiencing a recession in 2015, the primary industry (agriculture) accelerated again in 2016, but the growth rate in 2017 was not large; the secondary industry (industry) has almost shown a gradual slowdown since 2016 In contrast, the tertiary industry (service industry) performed strongly and gradually became the main force of India's GDP growth. India's film industry and tourism industry maintained a booming trend.

It shows that India is undergoing an era of industrial transformation, but can the weak primary and secondary industries support the huge tertiary industry? The underperforming secondary sector appears to be the main factor behind the slowdown in India's GDP growth. The GST reform (Goods and Service Tax, GST) has had a negative impact on the manufacturing sector, delaying related investment activities.

  <figcaption>Figure 2: India's GDP by Expenditure (% change in real terms) from FY15Q1 to FY17Q1</figcaption>
</figure>

From the above figure, we can see that India has gradually opened up its import and export trade. In recent years, India's import industry has performed better than its export industry. Government spending growth has slowed down, and so does personal consumption expenditure, which reveals that the GST reform has a significant impact on consumption. For example, after the reform, the tax rebate for auto parts in the past was only applicable to products within one year. Now auto dealers suffer because they have paid the tax for spare parts in the past. 23,000 dealers were affected. In addition, apart from the highest tax rate of 28%, high-end cars also have an additional 15% luxury tax. Although the total 43% is lower than the total tax rate of 55% in the past, Mercedes is still disappointed by the inequality among high-end car brands due to the tax reform. It asserts that with only a 28% tax rate, the premium car market would flourish, bringing more tax revenue, GDP growth and jobs to India.[^2]

### Indian industry (validation of conjectures 4): Industrial Production (IIP)
Quarterly GDP growth is not enough to monitor the latest  India's industrial climate, so we look at the monthly industrial production index. This is a composite indicator that measures the short-term changes in the volume of production of a basket of industrial products during a given period with respect to that in a chosen base period.[^3].

  <figcaption>Figure 3: India IIP index and its 12-month moving average trend from 2016 to 2017</figcaption>
</figure>

Although the GDP growth rate of India's secondary industry was extremely low in the quarter from March to July 2017, we can see from the above chart that after the bottom of IIP growth in June 2017, IIP increases strongly in the following two months. Although the GST tax reform has a great impact on the Indian industry, the government still released various policies for support and encouragement, which played a certain role in comforting the Indian industry.

### Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI)
In order to continue to verify conjecture 4, from the perspectives of bulk commodities and livelihood necessities, I consider WPI and CPI respectively.
