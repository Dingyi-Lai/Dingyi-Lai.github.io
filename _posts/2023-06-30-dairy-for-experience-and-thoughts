From April to June, I concluded my internship at my previous company, marking the end of an eventful chapter in my life. While it presented its fair share of challenges, I consider it a valuable opportunity to reshape my perspective and learn from talented individuals across various fields. Most importantly, I found myself on a quest to discover my own path.

During this period, alongside writing my master's thesis, I embarked on an enriching journey that took me from the United Kingdom to China. I had the pleasure of reconnecting with friends who played significant roles in their respective fields, allowing for stimulating exchanges of ideas and thoughts. Amidst these experiences, I grappled with the decision of whether to kickstart my career after obtaining my master's degree in Germany or in China. Each country possesses its own set of advantages and drawbacks.

Germany boasts a mature and thriving tech environment, coupled with a healthy working culture that ensures sustainable growth. It provides an ideal setting for me to foster stability and continuous development. On the other hand, China's tech landscape offers a different allure. With its vast population, the demand for cutting-edge technologies spans across diverse business domains, enabling swift and efficient application of various algorithms. Tech enthusiasts are actively involved in transforming theoretical knowledge into practical solutions, making China an enticing gold mine, especially with the emergence and rapid evolution of LLM.

After careful consideration, I have decided to try to embark on my career journey in Germany while remaining actively engaged in opportunities that the Chinese tech sphere presents. My primary objective is to enhance my understanding and application of different technologies, constantly evolving alongside the advancements brought forth by machines. This approach aligns with my personal growth aspirations and sets the stage for my unique path forward.
